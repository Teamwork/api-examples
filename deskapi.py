''' These are a few examples on how to use the Teamwork Desk API.

These examples are not comprehensive, but they should show how to use the API
for some of the most common tasks.

The full API documentation is available at http://developer.teamwork.com/desk/

For support email desk@teamwork.com

It is recommended that you run this with Python 3; but Python 2 should also
work.

To test this, start a Python console in the directory this file is located:

    $ python

And then use:

    import deskapi
    deskapi.install = 'https://your-url.teamwork.com'
    deskapi.key = 'your-key'

And you can now run the functions.
